						<h1>How to Become a Developer in 2024: The Do’s and Don’ts</h1>
						<p class="date">Posted on October 21, 2024</p>

							<strong
								>Embarking on the journey to become a web developer in 2024 can
								feel daunting, especially with the vast amount of information
								out there. Having made the transition from graphic design to
								front-end development myself, I’ve navigated the highs and lows
								of switching careers. Along the way, I’ve learned some valuable
								lessons about what works and what doesn’t.</strong
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							In this blog, I’ll share the do’s and don’ts I discovered during
							my journey to becoming a web developer, along with the challenges
							I faced, the resources that helped me, and the mindset that kept
							me moving forward.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Do: Build on Your Existing Skills</h2>
						<p>
							When I transitioned from graphic design to front-end development,
							I quickly realised that my design background gave me an advantage
							in web development. Creating visually appealing websites comes
							more naturally when you already understand principles like
							balance, colour theory, and typography. Don’t discount the skills
							you already have—they can serve as a strong foundation as you
							build your coding knowledge.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Don’t: Assume You Need to Know Everything at Once</h2>
						<p>
							It’s easy to feel like you need to master everything—HTML, CSS,
							JavaScript, frameworks, libraries—right away. This mindset can be
							overwhelming and counterproductive. When I started, I tried to
							learn too much too quickly and ended up frustrated. Instead, focus
							on mastering the basics first, then gradually expand your skill
							set. Becoming a developer is a marathon, not a sprint.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Do: Make Use of Online Resources</h2>
						<p>
							There are countless resources available to help you become a
							developer, and finding the right ones can make a huge difference.
							Here are some that really helped me along the way: <br />
							<br />
							<strong>• FreeCodeCamp</strong>: This was my go-to for hands-on
							learning. Their structured lessons and real-world projects helped
							me grasp fundamental concepts. <br />
							<br />
							<strong>• Frontend Mentor</strong>: Working on actual website
							designs was a game-changer for me. It pushed me to take what I’d
							learned from tutorials and apply it to real-world challenges.
							<br />
							<br />
							<strong>• Udemy</strong>: Sometimes, seeing a concept in action
							helps it click. Udemy has changed how I learn and practice coding
							principles and practices.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Don’t: Get Overwhelmed by the Choices</h2>
						<p>
							With so many courses, bootcamps, and tutorials, it’s easy to get
							overwhelmed. When I started, I found myself jumping from one
							resource to another, never fully committing to any one path.
							Choose a few resources that resonate with you, and stick with
							them. It’s better to go deep into a few topics than to skim the
							surface of many.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Do: Build a Portfolio... and do it early</h2>
						<p>
							One of the best things I did early on was to start building a
							portfolio. Even if your projects aren’t perfect, showing that you
							can take an idea and bring it to life is incredibly valuable. I
							started with small personal projects, bringing designs I’d created
							to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Don’t: Wait Until You Feel ‘Ready’</h2>
						<p>
							The truth is, you’ll never feel 100% ready. I used to hold off on
							starting projects because I thought I needed to learn more first.
							But the best way to learn is by doing. Don’t wait until you feel
							like you know everything—dive in, experiment, and learn from your
							mistakes along the way.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Do: Connect with Other Developers</h2>
						<p>
							Finding a community of other developers, especially those who are
							also just starting out, can make all the difference. Whether
							through Reddit, Discord, or Twitter, connecting with others helped
							me stay motivated and find solutions to problems I was facing.
							Plus, it’s nice to know you’re not alone in the challenges you
							face.
						</p>

						<h2>👉 Finally - Don't: Be Afraid to Ask for Help</h2>
						<p>
							When I first started, I hesitated to ask for help, thinking I
							needed to figure everything out on my own. But web development is
							a collaborative field, and no one knows everything. Asking for
							help when you’re stuck is a sign of growth, not weakness.
						</p>
						<h2>🥷 The Challenges I Faced</h2>
						<p>
							One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning to think like a
							developer. Coming from a design background, I was used to focusing
							on visuals, but coding required me to think about functionality
							and logic. It took time to develop this mindset, and there were
							moments of frustration, but it’s part of the process. <br />
							<br />
							Another challenge was the sheer amount of information available.
							It’s easy to fall into a rabbit hole of tutorials, and at times, I
							felt like I was drowning in resources. Finding a structured
							learning path and sticking to it made a big difference in keeping
							me focused.
							<br />
						</p>
						<h2>💭 Closing Thoughts..</h2>
						<p>
							<strong
								>The path to becoming a developer in 2024 is more accessible
								than ever, but it requires patience, persistence, and a
								willingness to embrace the challenges along the way. If you’re
								thinking about making the leap, whether from a design background
								like mine or something entirely different, just remember:
								everyone’s journey is unique. Keep learning, keep building, and
								enjoy the ride.</strong
