						<h1>Tackling Imposter Syndrome: from Doubt to Confidence</h1>

							<strong
								>When I first ventured into coding, I remember feeling like a
								fraud. I had made the shift from graphic design to front-end
								development, but no matter how much I studied or practiced,
								there was always this nagging voice telling me I didn’t belong.
								Imposter syndrome hit me hard, and if you’re reading this, you
								might be feeling the same. Trust me, you’re not alone, and I’ve
								been there.</strong
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							I want to share how I managed to navigate through imposter
							syndrome and build a career in web development, despite feeling
							like I didn’t have the ‘right’ background or wasn’t ‘good enough.’
							Here’s how I tackled those feelings and grew into the developer I
							am today.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Remind Yourself, Everyone Starts Somewhere</h2>
						<p>
							When I first began coding, it was easy to feel overwhelmed. I was
							surrounded by people who seemed like they’d been coding since
							birth. I came from a design background, and HTML, CSS, and
							JavaScript felt like a foreign language at first. Every time I
							Googled a solution, I worried that real developers didn’t need to
							look things up constantly.
							<br />
							<br />
							But here’s the thing: everyone starts somewhere. Even the most
							experienced developers once had no clue what they were doing. It’s
							easy to look at someone else’s success and feel inadequate, but
							you don’t see the thousands of hours they spent learning, failing,
							and trying again.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 Celebrate the Small Stuff</h2>
						<p>
							Early on, I often dismissed my progress. Solving a coding problem
							or building a simple website didn’t feel like much in the grand
							scheme of things. I thought, “Well, anyone can do this.” This
							attitude made it harder to see how far I was actually progressing.
							<br />
							<br />
							It wasn’t until I started celebrating small wins that I began to
							build my confidence. When I successfully fixed a bug or completed
							a project—even if it felt trivial—I gave myself credit for it.
							Every little success is a step toward mastery.
						</p>
						<h2>
							👉 Imposter Syndrome Doesn’t Disappear, but You Learn to Manage It
						</h2>
						<p>
							Here’s something I wish I knew earlier: Imposter syndrome doesn’t
							vanish. Even now, years into my career, it still sneaks up on me.
							But the difference is that I’ve learned how to manage it better. I
							no longer let it dictate my self-worth or my potential.
							<br /><br />
							Instead of thinking, “I’m not good enough,” I now ask, “How can I
							improve?” Rather than comparing myself to others, I compare myself
							to where I was a month ago, a year ago. Focusing on my own growth
							has been the most powerful tool to silence that inner critic.
						</p>
						<h2>👉 YOU BELONG HERE</h2>
						<p>
							The biggest lesson I learned is this: You belong in tech, no
							matter where you came from. Whether you transitioned from design,
							marketing, or an entirely different field, your unique background
							gives you a perspective that others might not have.
							<br /><br />
							I used to think that because I didn’t have a traditional computer
							science background, I was somehow ‘lesser.’ But over time, I
							realised that my design skills made me a better front-end
							developer, giving me an edge in creating intuitive and visually
							appealing user interfaces. Your past experiences aren’t a
							weakness—they’re your strength.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>
								Imposter syndrome is real, and it’s tough. But it doesn’t have
								to hold you back. By acknowledging your progress, connecting
								with others, and reframing your self-doubt into a growth
								mindset, you’ll not only become a better developer but also more
								confident in your abilities.
							</strong>
